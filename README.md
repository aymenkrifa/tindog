You heard about Tinder, didn't you? 
What about Tindog?

This is a small project in which I tried to create a website for an immaginary mobile application called Tindog.
The application offer several plans to adopt a dog.

I tried to use Bootstrap 4 for the first time in a project, but I have to say, the website doesn't look so bad in the end.
